# Final Code Check

## Key Observations and Fixes:

1. Environment Variable Check:
  * You've implemented checks for environment variables and stopped execution if any are missing. This is excellent for debugging.

2. FAISS Vector Store Initialization:
  * The FAISS initialization and fallback to create a new index are implemented well.
  * However, ensure `1536` matches the embedding dimensions of your OpenAI model. If your embeddings are of a different size, this will throw an error.

3. Wikipedia Tool:
  * If you're using `wikipediaapi` and it works fine in your environment, no changes are needed here.
  * If there are unresolved import issues for `wikipediaapi`, consider switching to the `wikipedia` package (already discussed).

4. Error Handling:
  * You have handled errors for loading FAISS and the exploration process (`try-except`). This is good, but ensure the error messages provide actionable insights.

5. Google Search API Wrapper:
  * The commented-out line for setting the `SERPAPI_API_KEY` can be removed if not needed.

6. Caching in `vectorstore`:
  * Ensure `vectorstore.add_texts()` is correctly saving embeddings and metadata. The `query_embedding` should match the dimensions of the FAISS index.

7. File Operations:
  * You properly handle `faiss_index.pkl` with both read and write operations. This ensures persistence of the vector store.

8. Streamlit Flow:
  * The Streamlit interface is clear and intuitive. Users can input a topic and see results without ambiguity.

## Potential Improvements:

1. Graceful Failure for Missing Data:
  * In fetch_youtube_videos, if the YouTube search fails (e.g., rate limits), handle the error gracefully and return an empty list with a warning to the user.

2. Optimize the similarity_search_by_vector:
  * Ensure k=1 suffices for your use case. You might want to expand k if there's a possibility of multiple relevant matches and filter based on a threshold similarity score.

3. Unused Code Cleanup:
  * Remove the commented-out alternate explore_topic function for clarity unless you intend to keep it as a reference.

4. Type Annotations:
  * While your functions are well-defined, type annotations for inputs and return values make the code more readable and maintainable.

  Example:
  ```python
  def fetch_youtube_videos(query: str, max_results: int = 3) -> list[dict]:
  ```

5. Dynamic Error Handling for API Keys:
  * Add a prompt to guide users if they’re missing API keys:
  ```python
  if not serpapi_api_key:
    st.error("SERP API key is missing. Please set SERPAPI_API_KEY in your environment variables.")
  ```

6. Logging:
  * Consider adding logging for debugging and tracking. For example,
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
  logging.info("Exploring topic: %s", topic)
  ```

## Final Test Scenarios:

Run the following tests to validate functionality:

1. Enter a valid topic and ensure all outputs (summary, images, and videos) display correctly.
2. Test with a nonexistent topic (e.g., gibberish text) and confirm error messages are user-friendly.
3. Remove one or more environment variables to verify error handling stops execution gracefully.
4. Simulate a rate limit or failure for YouTube or Unsplash APIs to confirm the app doesn’t crash.
5. Load and use the faiss_index.pkl file to verify vector store persistence.

Let me know if you encounter specific issues during testing or have additional requirements!
