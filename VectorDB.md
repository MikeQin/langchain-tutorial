# Vector Database

A vector database can be used to find similar questions by storing and querying embeddings of the text. If a question is similar to a previously asked one, you can fetch the cached response instead of making a new API call. Here's how you can set it up:

### How This Works

1. Generate Embeddings:
  * Convert the input question into a vector using OpenAIâ€™s embeddings model (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002).

2. Store Embeddings:
  * Store the vector representation of the question along with its response in a vector database like Pinecone, Weaviate, or FAISS.

3. Search for Similar Questions:
  * Query the vector database with the new questionâ€™s embedding to find similar stored embeddings.

4. Use Cached Response:
  * If a similar question is found, use its cached response. If not, call the API and store the new question-response pair.

### Implementation

1. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install openai pinecone-client faiss-cpu
```

2. Initialize Vector Database

Hereâ€™s an example using `FAISS` (local vector database):

```python
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Initialize FAISS Index
dimension = 1536  # Embedding size for text-embedding-ada-002
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)

# Store metadata (question-response pairs)
cached_data = {}
```

3. Generate and Store Embeddings

```python
import openai
import json

openai.api_key = "your_openai_api_key"

def get_embedding(text):
    response = openai.Embedding.create(
        model="text-embedding-ada-002",
        input=text
    )
    return response["data"][0]["embedding"]

def store_question_response(question, response):
    embedding = get_embedding(question)
    index.add(np.array([embedding]))
    cached_data[len(cached_data)] = {"question": question, "response": response}
    print(f"Stored: {question} -> {response}")
```

4. Search for Similar Questions

```python
def search_similar_question(question, threshold=0.8):
    embedding = np.array([get_embedding(question)])
    distances, indices = index.search(embedding, k=1)  # Find the closest match
    if distances[0][0] < threshold:
        matched_index = indices[0][0]
        return cached_data.get(matched_index)
    return None
```

5. Integrate with OpenAI API

```python
def get_response_with_cache(question):
    # Search for similar questions
    cached_result = search_similar_question(question)
    if cached_result:
        print("Using cached response.")
        return cached_result["response"]
    
    # If no similar question, call OpenAI API
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": question}]
    )["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    
    # Store the question and response
    store_question_response(question, response)
    return response
```

**Usage**
```python
# Ask a question
response = get_response_with_cache("What is the capital of France?")
print(response)

# Ask a similar question
response = get_response_with_cache("Which city is the capital of France?")
print(response)
```

### Scaling with Cloud Vector Databases
For large-scale applications, consider cloud-based vector databases:

1. Pinecone:
  * Highly scalable and managed.
  * Documentation: Pinecone Docs
2. Weaviate:
  * Open-source and supports hybrid search.
  * Documentation: Weaviate Docs
3. Milvus:
  * High-performance open-source solution.
  * Documentation: Milvus Docs

## Next Steps

* Migrating to a cloud-based vector database?
* Optimizing the search and embedding logic?
* Exploring fine-tuning a model to improve similar-question matching? ðŸ˜Š
